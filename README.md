Simplified Data Driven Prediction of Self-Sufficiency of PV-Battery System Using Machine Learning
This is a master thesis project, aiming to predict the self-sufficiency using the machine learning.
Two models are trained, one is the random forest, the other is neural network.
The two scripts end up with "_training" are the main script to implement cross validation and train the model.
